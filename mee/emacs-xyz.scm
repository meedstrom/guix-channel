Limitations;
- only supports `advice-add', `advice-remove', and `advice-member-p'.
- only handles the :before, :after, :override, and :around kinds of advice;
- requires a named rather than anonymous function;
- and does not support any additional properties like `name' or `depth'.

It was tested on Emacs-22 and I can't see any obvious reason why it
wouldn't work on older Emacsen.")

Emacs Lisp files that provide the correct feature (matching the

Where a package manager might depend on metadata, Packed instead
uses some heuristics to get the same information — that is slower

package recipes.

This package is format by itself, so you can view format effect.

Below are commands you can use:

`elisp-format-region'
     Format region or defun.
`elisp-format-buffer'
     Format buffer.
`elisp-format-file'
     Format file.
`elisp-format-file-batch'
     Format file with `batch'.
`elisp-format-directory'
     Format recursive elisp files in directory.
`elisp-format-directory-batch'
     Format recursive elisp files in directory with `batch'.\n`elisp-format-dired-mark-files'
     Format dired marked files.
`elisp-format-library'
     Format library.

Tips:

If current mark is active, command `elisp-format-region'
will format region you select, otherwise it will format
`defun' around point.

If you want format many files, you can marked them in dired,
and use command `elisp-format-dired-mark-files' to format
marked files in dired.

You can format special file through
command `elisp-format-file'.

By default, when you format `huge' file, it will
hang emacs.
You can also use command `elisp-format-file-batch'
make format process at background.

You also can use command `elisp-format-directory'
format all recursive elisp files in special directory.

By default, when you use command `elisp-format-directory'
format too many elisp files, will hang emacs.
You can also use command `elisp-format-directory-batch'
make format process at background.

If you're sure lazy, you can use command `elisp-format-library'
format special library and don't need input long file path.

Note:

I can't ensure this package can perfect work with all situations.
So please let me know if you have suggestion or bug.


Installation:

Put elisp-format.el to your load-path.
The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))

And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'elisp-format)

No need more.

Put the following into your .emacs file (~/.emacs.d/init.el) to enable context menu.

This function does not depend on GUI, it is fully available on terminal.
The menu is launched by \"right click\" (<mouse-3>) by default, but you can assign any key.

thread while paused.

The main components of this package are `aio-defun' / `aio-lambda'
to define async function, and `aio-await' to pause these functions
while they wait on asynchronous events. When an asynchronous
function is paused, the main thread is not blocked. It is no more
or less powerful than callbacks, but is nicer to use.

This is implementation is based on Emacs 25 generators, and
asynchronous functions are actually iterators in disguise, operated
as stackless, asymmetric coroutines.

* Making Org-mode Beautiful
** This theme is dedicated to my wife Shell
  Who—in her beauty, her love, and her love for beauty—has shown me
  that form can enhance function.
* Mission
  - Make org mode headlines easy to read.  In any theme.
  - Make it look more like a published book and/or desktop app, less
    like angry fruit salad.
  - Make it awesome to live in an org buffer.
* Usage
  Load this theme over top your existing theme, and you should be
  golden.  If you find any incompatibilities, let me know with what
  theme and I will try and fix it.

  When loading a whole new theme overtop, org-beautify-theme will
  still be active with the old theme.  Just unload org-beautify-theme
  and then reload it, and everything will be fine again.

  If you still get really ugly headlines, customize the
  ~org-beautify-theme-use-box-hack~ variable and set it to nil (false).

* Changelog
   - v0.4 :: [2017-09-08]
     - Add org-beautify-theme-use-box-hack to allow the user to
       fix ugly boxes.
   - v0.3.2 :: [2017-08-29]
     - Update License
   - v0.3.1 :: [2016-10-19]
     - Fix load path issues (Thanks PierreTechoueyres!)
     - reverse chronological changelog, because ah-doy!
   - v0.2 :: [2016-08-08]
     - Better repository Location
     - Fix so that you can load the theme properly.
   - v0.1.2 :: [2014-01-06]
     - Add Verdana font to fall back on
   - v0.1.1 :: [2014-01-06]
     - Fix checkboxes
   - v0.1 :: First Release
     - Make the colors suck a lot less, and the buffers look a lot nicer.

    (description
      "This package defines a global minor mode to display Icomplete
completion candidates vertically.  You could get a vertical display
without this package, by using (setq icomplete-separator \"\
\"), but
that has two problems which `icomplete-vertical-mode' solves:

1. Usually the minibuffer prompt and the text you type scroll off
   to the left!  This conceals the minibuffer prompt, and worse,
   the text you enter.

2. The first candidate appears on the same line as the one you are
   typing in.  This makes it harder to visually scan the candidates
   as the first one starts in a different column from the others.

For users that prefer the traditional horizontal mode for Icomplete
but want to define some commands that use vertical completion, this
package provides the `icomplete-vertical-do' macro.  For example to
define a command to yank from the kill-ring using completion:

(defun insert-kill-ring-item ()
  \"Insert item from kill-ring, selected with completion.\"
  (interactive)
  (icomplete-vertical-do (:separator \"\
··········\
\" :height 20)
    (insert (completing-read \"Yank: \" kill-ring nil t))))

Both the :separator and :height are optional and default to
icomplete-vertical-separator and to
icomplete-vertical-prospects-height, respectively.
If you omit both parts you still need to include the empty
parenthesis: (icomplete-vertical-do () ...)!.

      "modern-fringes is meant to replace the arguably ugly default fringe bitmaps
with more modern, easier on the eyes ones.  They are very simple to use,
simply use the modern-fringes-mode.  As one knows, you may use customize to
make the mode permanent.  It is a global minor mode, so it will affect all
buffers.

It is suggested to use the following function in your init file to
use modern-fringes at intended.  It makes the truncation arrows appear
transparent, making a very easy on the eyes zipper-effect.

   (modern-fringes-invert-arrows)

Depending on your theme, it may not work
properly.  In that case, you can edit the bitmap faces as you wish in your
config.  modern-fringes was designed assuming the fringe width is 8 pixels
wide.  It will likely look strange if the width is any less or more.")
